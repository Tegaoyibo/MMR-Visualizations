This Repository is to house all the csv files, workbook files, and presentation slides associated with my
Maternal Mortality Rate (US) project.

I used MySQL and Tableau to complete this project.
  MySQL was used to clean the dataset (addressing any format inconsistencies, deleting unecessary columns, and changing the 
  csv files to be compatible with Tableau.)

  Tableau was used to create the visualizations of the project.
